## User Stories
1. As a user who found something important, I want to be able to report it on the "Found Page", so that people can find it.
2. As a user who found lost something, I want to be able to seach the "Found Page" for it, so that I can contact the one who found it. 
3. As an admin, I want to be able to edit the found page and remove items, so that I can remove inappropriate items from the list.
4. As an admin, I want to be able to look through all the users, so that I can ban ones posting innapropriate thing.
5. As a user who previously posted a found item, I want to be able to remove it from the "Found Page", so that it isn't on the list after the owner got it back.
6. As a user who's seen something found by another user, I want to be able to update it's location (if it's a moving item), so people can  track it.
7. As a user who needs an item after the disaster, I want to be able to request an item even if I haven't lost it, so that I can get an item I need.
