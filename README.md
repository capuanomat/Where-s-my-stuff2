## Priorities and M7 Requirements
- Add Google map and everything related to that
- Fix found and registration page so it's less buggy and hacky

## Future Ideas & Extra Credit Ideas:
- Make the UI prettier
- Register through a social media
- Implement app in different language(s) (Matt can do French)
- Add a splash screen with animation- that runs when the app boots up (comes under the pretty UI category)
- Add a walkthrough (also pretty UI, but mostly for user friendliness)
