"Where's My Stuff?" Trailer Concept: What to do if we have time to kill and/or experience burnout

Actors:
A person who lost their pet (hereafter referred to as pet-seeker)
A person who found said pet (hereafter referred to as cafe-person)
The pet (don't know if it's a cat or a dog yet)


Showcase both sides of users:
"I lost my dog"
User Scenario: Pet-seeker tries to locate their pet (probably a dog if we want our branding game to be strong and consistent).


"I found a pup looking like [insert description]... Friends, if you know the person who owns this, hit me up"
User Scenario: Cafe-person 100 miles away (artistic license...) posts a picture of lost pet on Facebook and then a friend recommends the "Where's My Stuff" app. Person downloads it, creates a profile, and reports the lost animal.


Rough sketch of the script/events in it:
1- Pet paws the coffeeshop window, and cafe-person thinks, "I wonder if [pet] has an owner," posts the animal to social media. Cut to 2
2- Distance shot of pet-seeker near disaster rubble...
3- Zoom closer to pet-seeker yelling out the name of the pet - yells at least twice (in desperation if more calls for pet)... e.g. "Toto! Toto!" Cut to 4
4- Cafe-person is recommended the "Where's My Stuff" app in the comments section. Jump to person creating a profile. Cut to 5
5- Pet-seeker reports lost animal on "Where's My Stuff"
6- Cafe-person reports lost animal with picture
7- Pet-seeker's phone vibrates with a notification from WMS. Message from person in cafe: "I believe this is your [pet]" Conversation in texts about logistics.
8- Cafe-person delivers dog and the pet-seeker is finally happy.
9- Where's My Stuff logo
