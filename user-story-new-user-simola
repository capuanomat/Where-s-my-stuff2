******************USER STORY 1: FIRST-TIME USER******************
"As a first time user, I want to be able to register on the app, so that I can
post lost or found items."

Tasks:
Create new account based on the following text fields:
    - Username
    - Password
    - Location/Hometown
Verify that the username is not already taken, and suggest another similar one
that isn't (if the user suggests one that is).

Create an option to gather information from social media for a faster sign-up.
Allow users to access the new-user sign in screen from the existing users
screen in two ways:
    -After passing in a nonexistent username
    -Through a message for new users to sign up

-----------
How the user gets there:

GIVEN: The user goes to the login screen for returning users.

    the login, and proceeds with it (presses OK).
        THEN: System prompts user with the message "Sorry, that username doesn't
        exist."
        Along with that comes the option to create a username: "Sign up
        here."
    WHEN: The user clicks on a link to the new user sign up activity (says
    something like "New users sign up here").
        THEN: The user goes to the new user sign up activity.

        THEN: Allow the user to sign up (default) or (SEE RETURNING USER) go to
        the sign-in screen for returning users.
