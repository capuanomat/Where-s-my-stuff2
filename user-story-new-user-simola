******************USER STORY 1: FIRST-TIME USER******************
"As a first time user, I want to be able to register on the app, so that I can
post lost or found items."

Tasks:
Create new account based on the following text fields:
    - Username
    - Password
    - Location/Hometown
Verify that the username is not already taken, and suggest another similar one
that isn't (if the user suggests one that is).

Create an option to gather information from social media for a faster sign-up.
Allow users to access the new-user sign in screen from the existing users
screen in two ways:
    -After passing in a nonexistent username
    -Through a message for new users to sign up

-----------
How the user gets there:

GIVEN: The user goes to the login screen for returning users.
    WHEN: The user tries to pass a nonexistent email address or username into
    the login, and proceeds with it (presses OK).
        THEN: System prompts user with the message "Sorry, that username doesn't
        exist."
        Along with that comes the option to create a username: "Sign up
        here."
            WHEN: The user clicks on said link.
            THEN: The user goes to the new sign up activity, except the field
            for a new username is pre-filled (but still editable).
    WHEN: The user clicks on a link to the new user sign up activity (says
    something like "New users sign up here").
        THEN: The user goes to the new user sign up activity.

GIVEN: The very first boot of the app.
    WHEN: The user goes through the tutorial.
        THEN: Allow the user to sign up (default) or (SEE RETURNING USER) go to
        the sign-in screen for returning users.
    WHEN: The user skips the tutorial (or exits at any point).
        THEN: Allow the user to sign up (default) or (SEE RETURNING USER) go to
        the sign-in screen for returning users.

-----------
How the user signs up:

GIVEN: The user lands on the sign-up page.
    WHEN: The user has already passed in a user name before landing on the
    sign-up page.
        THEN: The user name field is already filled but the user can edit it
        and proceed with the password and contact info.
    WHEN: The user tries to pass in a user name that's already taken.
        THEN: Suggest a new user name that appends a number to the end of what
        the user initially passed in.
    WHEN: The user passes in and confirms an invalid password.
        THEN: Stay on the page, clear the password and confirmation fields,
        display a message outlining the password requirements and put a red
        outline around the box.
    WHEN: The user passes in a valid (non-taken) username and password.
        THEN: Go to the page for the next action, which is a choice between
        reporting a missing item, reporting a sighting of an item, and donating.

----------

Done-Done Criteria:
-Registration validates username (not taken) and password (strong enough)
    -...and suggests a new similar username if taken
-Registration offers a redirect to the main login activity (Returning User?)
-User goes into databases when the "OK" button is pressed
-User can cancel registration (clears all fields)
-Require username, password, and location/hometown fields (asterisks and red highlighting in case of empty fields)
    -Validate the inputs for all fields to ensure allowable characters
        -emails: ensure name@site.dom format
