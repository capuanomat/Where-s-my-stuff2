-----------------------------PREFACE--------------------------------------------
This is the first time any of us has fleshed out an idea on a text file, so a few things:
Feel free to add your ideas relating to the trailer to this file: concept-for-app-trailer.txt
Otherwise, if you have a nice, big, pretty well-fleshed-out idea and have a lot to say about it, create a new text file. And if it gets big and you want the file to have sections, please mention them at the beginning so we can search and skip to them...
And never forget to commit to the repo! This is how you get heard and we see the ideas :D

--------------------------TRAILER CONCEPT---------------------------------------
Actors:
A person who lost their pet (hereafter referred to as pet-seeker)
A person who found said pet (hereafter referred to as cafe-person)
The pet (don't know if it's a cat or a dog yet)

Showcase both sides of users:
"I lost my dog"
User Scenario: Pet-seeker tries to locate their pet (probably a dog if we want our branding game to be strong and consistent).

"I found a pup looking like [insert description]... Friends, if you know the person who owns this, hit me up"
User Scenario: Cafe-person 100 miles away (artistic license...) posts a picture of lost pet on Facebook and then a friend recommends the "Where's My Stuff" app. Person downloads it, creates a profile, and reports the lost animal.

Rough sketch of the script/events in it:
1- Pet paws the coffeeshop window, and cafe-person thinks, "I wonder if [pet] has an owner," posts the animal to social media. Cut to 2
2- Distance shot of pet-seeker near disaster rubble...
3- Zoom closer to pet-seeker yelling out the name of the pet - yells at least twice (in desperation if more calls for pet)... e.g. "Toto! Toto!" Cut to 4
4- Cafe-person is recommended the "Where's My Stuff" app in the comments section. Jump to person creating a profile. Cut to 5
5- Pet-seeker reports lost animal on "Where's My Stuff"
6- Cafe-person reports lost animal with picture
7- Pet-seeker's phone vibrates with a notification from WMS. Message from person in cafe: "I believe this is your [pet]" Conversation in texts about logistics.
8- Cafe-person delivers dog and the pet-seeker is finally happy.
9- Where's My Stuff logo


-------------WHAT'S THIS GOT TO DO WITH ANYTHING?-------------------------------
This is not just about cute puppies and/or the opportunity to interact with animals as a stress reliever. (In fact, filming and editing would probably counteract those effects...)

Business Value:
If we proceed with the splash screen and the revised puppy logo, this could enhance our branding and make it more cohesive.
You know the Android app store and how some apps on the Android app store have videos that describe or promote them? This could be like one of those.
This demonstrates that the app doesn't just have some niche use and could be of use to even those who feel invincible and well-connected, like city-dwellers.
This shows our app in action and could show our beautiful UI.
This shows happy users.
